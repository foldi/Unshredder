Instagram released a challenge similar to DARPA's Shredder Challenge... create an algorithm that reconstructs a "shredded" photograph into its original form. This Processing build is my solution to the challenge. 

You can find more information about the challenge on the Instagram Engineering blog at http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder

If you'd like to unshred your own images, download the project and follow these instructions:

1. You'll need Processing... if you don't have it, download it at http://processing.org/download/

2. Your shredded images must be 640px wide and "shredded" into strips of equal widths. Add them to the "data" folder.

3. Load the unshred.pde vis Processing and find the keyPressed() function at the bottom.

4. Edit the loadSourceImage() calls... set the first parameter to your image file name. Set the second parameter to "true".

5. Run.
